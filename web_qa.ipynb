In-person attendees will also be able to join breakout sessions led by members of OpenAIâs technical staff.Since launching our API in 2020, weâve continuously updated it to include our most advanced models, making it easier than ever for developers to integrate cutting-edge AI into their projects with a simple API call. Today, over 2 million developers are using GPT-4, GPT-3.5, DALLÂ·E and Whisper for a wide range of use casesâfrom integrating smart assistants into existing applications to building entirely new applications and services that weren't possible before.âWeâre looking forward to showing our latest work to enable developers to build new things,â said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.Â To learn more, check out devday.openai.com and sign up to receive a notification when registration opens in the coming weeks. For press who are interested in attending in person, please reach out to devdaypress@openai.com.\n",
